# WeatherApp-thinkWik

Objective:

Build a simple Weather App that fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a well-structured UI. The app should include proper layout, API integration, and user interaction.

📌 Requirements:

1️⃣ UI & Layout

    •    The app should have a clean Weather Dashboard with the following elements:
    •    Search Bar – Allow users to search for a city.
    •    Current Weather Section – Display the city name, temperature, weather description, and an icon.
    •    Forecast Section – Show a horizontal scrollable list of weather predictions for the next 5 days.
    •    Use Auto Layout / Constraints to ensure proper UI adaptability across different screen sizes.

2️⃣ API Integration

    •    Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch:
    •    Current Weather
    •    5-Day Forecast
    •    Parse and display data in the UI.

3️⃣ Features

    •    Implement Pull to Refresh to reload data.
    •    Show an Activity Indicator while loading data.
    •    Handle Error Cases (e.g., invalid city, no internet connection).
    •    Implement Dark Mode Support.

📌 Time Limit: 3 Hours

    •    UI Design & Layout
    •    API Integration & Parsing
    •    Feature Implementation & Testing
